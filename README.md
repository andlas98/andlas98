## Howdy 👋🏿, and welcome to my GitHub!

I am a frontend engineer building web-based tools. Some are meant for personal use, and some are intended to be helpful to me and others.

💬 I love working with:
- JS Frameworks (React and Nextjs)
- _Anything_ that simplifies web element styling (Tailwind, GSAP)

🔭 Currently Working on:
- A minimalistic and sleek Pomodoro timer built on Typescript, GSAP, and Electron.
